# LOGO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Please save the Aegis Ignis logo image (the attached shield with fire image) as:

1. `Smart Building Dashboard Design/src/assets/logo.png`
2. `face-registration/src/assets/logo.png`

The code has been updated to use these logo files.

The logo should be the shield design with:
- Blue and dark blue split shield
- Orange/yellow flames on top
- Circuit board patterns on the left side
- Fire/flame design on the right side
- Stars at the bottom

Once you save the logo.png files in both assets folders, the landing pages will display the correct logo.
